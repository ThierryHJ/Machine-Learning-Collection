### Summary

Model Selection & Evaluation

- Evaluation Method
  - Continuous: MSE
  - Classification: Accuracy, Entropy
- Overfitting
  - Training Error/Empirical Error 
  - Generalization Error
  - When learner learns about specific tasks too much(lower training error), it may decrease the ability on learning general tasks(higher generalization error)
- Bias-Variance Trade-off

### Demonstration

- Implement Cross Validation with Python (Cross Validation.ipynb)
