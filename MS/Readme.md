### Summary

Model Selection & Evaluation

- Evaluation Method
  - Continuous: 
    MSE
  - Classification: 
    Accuracy, Entropy, Precision & Recall & TPR & FPR & F1 score, ROC & AUC & cost curve
  
Overfitting

- Training Error/Empirical Error 
- Generalization Error
- When learner learns about specific tasks too much(lower training error), it may decrease the ability on learning general tasks(higher generalization error)

Bias-Variance Trade-off
